1. Java

I did this automation to complete a technical test, but they only gave me one day to complete the task. It was about the Flood Fill function. Because Java was new, I'm not pushing my expectations too high. Fortunately, the company accepted and I could move to the next step for user interviews.


2. Python

I learned Python at my previous company, XL Axiata. It was with BDD too, but it was just for API microservices, and now I do learn for web automation like Kompas.com.


3. Katalon

This tool I first learned this in my boot camp period and until I early 6 months joined my previous company, I still use it. After that, I barely moved to Python BDD as I mentioned before. I like this tool because it's a simple way to make automation such as for the web, mobile, and API. I usually use this tool for mobile testing in my previous Bootcamp and job.
